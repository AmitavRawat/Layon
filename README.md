## About the Project
Layon allows users to strategically and geographically plan their next career moves while avoiding the "layoff hotspots". 

## Usage
Clicking on the map will bring up the number of layoffs in that state. Additionally, it will provide the layoffs per city basis and links to apply for jobs. 
The slider and buttons can be used to change the year and month and will update the layoff data based on the new date. We used machine learning and time screening 
predict the layoffs in the future years.
